# chess_pawn_push
Chess game with slight rule adjustments created as a Final Project for a high school computer science course.

This game plays exactly like chess, except for a few changes:
- The win condition is to get your pawn to the other side of the board, instead of checkmate
- Instead of moving a piece, you can place any captured pawn on a free space on your half of the board.

Check is still in place for preventing castling, but otherwise, the king acts as any other piece (a piece cannot be "pinned" because it is protecting the king, for example).
